      <h2>What is Mapcart?</h2>
      <p id="leftAlign">With the success of franchises like Dungeons and Dragons, Game of Thrones, The Hobbit, Star Wars, Skyrim, and The Witcher 3, many ambitious fans have taken to creating their own fictional worlds.
         Whether for indie games, novels, or just for fun, a huge amount of people spend a significant portion of their time telling stories about places
         that don't exist. One common theme of these fictional "places" is exploration -- prospective authors and dungeonmasters must map geography,
         city locations, and sometimes even political boundaries.</p>
      <p id="leftAlign">Here at Mapcart we make maps.  Regardless of your plans, we will provide you with a high-quality image of a map with detailed geography, location marking, and outlines of the political sphere.
         Maps can be bought in color or in classic sepia at even less cost, and the store updates once a month.  Don't waste weeks trying to draw the perfect shorelines.  Choose Mapcart.<p>
